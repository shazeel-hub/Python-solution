### 🐍 **Python Basics - If, While, and Lists**  

This repository contains fundamental Python scripts that demonstrate basic programming concepts, including conditional statements, loops, and lists.  

##  **Topics Covered**  

1️⃣ **Conditional Statements (`if` - `elif` - `else`)**  
   - Checks conditions and executes code accordingly.  
   - Example:
     ```python
     num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
     if num > 0:
         print("Positive number")
     elif num < 0:
         print("Negative number")
     else:
         print("Zero")
     ```

2️⃣ **While Loops (`while` loop)**  
   - Repeats code while a condition is `True`.  
   - Example:
     ```python
     count = 0
     while count < 3:
         print("Count:", count)
         count += 1
     ```

3️⃣ **Lists and Iteration**  
   - Stores multiple items in a variable.  
   - Example:
     ```python
     fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
     for fruit in fruits:
         print(fruit)
     ...
